# odin-recipes

This is a basic recipes website that I will build using just HTML.

This website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes.

Once I have completed the project I will have demonstrated that I learned:
- How to work with text in HTML
- How to use links and images in HTML
- How to use ordered and unordered lists in HTML
